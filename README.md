# NETCAT

This application is deployed [here](https://networkcatalogue.herokuapp.com/).

## Inspiration
As current college students, we felt overwhelmed by the sheer number of event emails and postings we receive on a daily basis. Whether they were invitations to club information sessions to large-scale networking events, we felt pressured to take advantage of all the opportunities we possibly can.

## Our Proposal
For this reason, we created NETCAT, a web-based application that will automatically parse through many USC websites to generate events on our centralized event platform. Through NETCAT, users will be able to
- View all their upcoming events on our live map and filter for specific events
- Create account and add events to their favorite list
- Share events across different social media platforms
- Add events directly to their Google Calendar
This eliminates the need to constantly perform a brute-force search through all their emails and go back-and-forth between several event sites.
